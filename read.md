# Vehicle Routing and Facility Mapping in Nairobi

## Project Description

This project visualizes the routing of vehicles to various hospitals and chiefs' camps in Nairobi using geospatial analysis. It combines several Python libraries to create an interactive map that displays the locations of facilities and the routes taken by vehicles. The project uses optimization techniques to calculate the most efficient paths to visit multiple locations.

## Features

- Interactive map visualization of hospitals and chiefs' camps in Nairobi.
- Dynamic routing for vehicles using NetworkX and Google OR-Tools.
- Visualization of routes on the map with animated vehicle markers.
- Heatmap representation of distances between facilities.
